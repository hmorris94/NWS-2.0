# Focused Forecast Explorer

A lightweight, single-page NOAA/NWS forecast dashboard that lets you focus on a handful of locations, sweep time windows, and visualize multiple metrics without the 48-block grid.

## Features

- Curated location list for quick switching.
- Sliding time window for hourly forecasts.
- Overlay graphs grouped by metric category.
- Hover tooltips and day separators.
- Auto-refresh every 15 minutes.

npm run dev
```
